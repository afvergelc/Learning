# Learning
Hi!  Welcome to my "Learning" repository. This is a personal space where I track my journey of learning new programming languages and practicing through various courses and tutorials from platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and YouTube.  Here, you'll find my notes, exercises, and projects related to SQL, Python, Snowflake, and more!
